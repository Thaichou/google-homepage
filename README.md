This project will test my ability to deconstruct and rebuild the Google homepage. 


I will identify the following:

1. Two ways to move a div around the page.
   
    a. Use the position property (such as position: static;) to fix the element in place according to the normal flow of the page.
   
    b. Use the float property (such as float: left;) to place the items in the left position inside of its container.

2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page.

    a. Use the position: fixed; property or the position: absolute; property.

3. Indentify the background color of an existing webpage.

    a. Use the developer tools in the browser by pressing F12.

4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage.

    a. Can once again use the developer tools to look at elements tab and grab the link from the img element.

5. Center an element horizontally.

    a. There are a number of ways to do this. One of the ways I achieved this was using flex property align-items: center;.

6. Indentify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page.

    a. Inline styling: use the style element directly inside of the HTML document.
    
    b. Internal styling: use the <style> element in the <head> section of the HTML document.
    
    c. External styling: <link> to an external CSS stylesheet within the HTML document.

7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on a page.
    
    a. Class attributes in HTML are denoted with the '.' in CSS. For example, if I wanted to make the class of 'class="navigation"' in my HTML document, I would target that element with '.navigation' in CSS. 
    
    b. Id attributes in HTML are denoted with the '#' in CSS. If I used the id of 'id="navigation"', I would target that element with '#navigation' in CSS.

8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't go anywhere).

    a. The <form> element is used in HTML to make a basic form.
